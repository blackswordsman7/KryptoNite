## Property Management System using Hyperledger Fabric

### Idea at Glance:

Our aim is to provide a Hyperledger Fabric based model which will give government full control and monetization of all the land in India. This Platform will rule out corruption by Middle Men, and will assist government recover all the black money invested in Properties ( Benami Property).

### Current Challenges:

Current system is except if either Seller/Buyer is a bad partipant.

1. **Bad partcipant:**
* Seller: It may produce fake copy of the certification for getting double mortgage/multiple registration/multiple general power of attorney/Encroachments.
* Buyer: For avoiding registration fee, they dont go to tehsildar for document verification, otherwise buyer want to invest their black money. (Benami Property)
* Another Bad Partcipant ? **Corruption**: Document tampering by corrupt govt. officials.

2. **Accuracy:**
* Data manually entered more than once, perpetuates the system; data spread across multiple agencies.
3. **Efficiency:** 
* Documents touched by many hands; unify the conveyance and the public record.
4. **Security:** 
* Records from all of us held by all of us.

### Future Goals: 
1. The Public Layer of Hyperledger Fabric Platform will work as an more reliable online real Estate Agent.
2. Crackdown on benami property, and properties exploiting government regulations such as Wrong Layouts.
